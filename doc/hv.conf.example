[voltage]
# MAXVOLTAGE is the highest voltage the HV PSU can produce in kV.  For
# negative polarity devices, the value is negative.  The value is used
# e.g. for scaling the 12-bit integer, which the Technix serial
# protocol uses for setting the voltage value.
MAX_VOLTAGE=-100.0

# VOLTAGELIMIT is the maximum voltage for the particular application
# in kV.  The module will not ever push the voltage above the limit.
# For negative polarity PSU the value should be negative.
VOLTAGE_LIMIT=-20.0

[current]
# MAXCURRENT is the highes current the HV PSU can produce in mA. The
# value is used e.g. for scaling the 12-bit integer, which the Technix
# serial protocol uses for setting the current value.
MAX_CURRENT=50.0

# CURRENTLIMIT is the maximum current for the particular application
# in mA.  The module will not ever set the current above the limit.
CURRENT_LIMIT=5.0

[serial]
# The device is the name of the serial device file
device = /dev/ttyUSB0

# Technix SR100kV-5kW uses RS232 line specs: 1 start bit, 8 data bits,
# 1 stop bit, no parity, Full Duplex mode, baud rate 9600
baudrate = 9600
databits = 8
parity   = N
stopbit  = 1
startbit = 1
